# Work Day Scheduler


## About this Project

This project was intented to be my first attempt at utilizing third party apis to create a work day scheduler in which the user would enter in an event and would click save and the webpage would save the contents after a reload. This project proved to be challenging and it is clear that I will need to spend more time on APIs before I will be able to master them. The comments in the code are meant to represent the general ideas I had to make the code work to the best of my ability will be utilized when I eventually go back to fix this project in order to meet the full acceptance criteria.# work-day-scheduler
